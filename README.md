# Morra Game

This project was for my Part II Software Engineering Course at the University of Auckland. <br />
The objective was to create a sophisticated, strategy-based bot opponent for the traditional hand game, Morra.<br />

## Requirements
**OOP**: I must use Object-Oriented programming to develop a solution. <br />
**Design Patterns**: I must implement a Factory & Strategy design pattern.<br />
**Java Conventions**: I must follow proper java conventions and best practices such as CNAME, MNAME, VNAME,commenting and others <br />
**Time Limit**: I was given a 3-week fixed deadline.

## Testing
Unit testing was performed using the JUnit testing framework. <br />
These tests were designed to ensure that the requirements of OOP, Design Patterns, Code Style and functionality were kept.

## What I could improve on
**Dynamic Bot Strategy:** Currently, the strategy for the bot is predetermined by the difficulty of the game and the number of games played. 
I could implement a feature of a dynamic strategy allowing the bot to record which strategy works best against a particular player. Hence the bot can adapt its own strategy based on its knowledge, increasing the challenge. <br />
**GUI:** The current game is solely played on the console; adding a graphical user interface would enhance the user experience.<br />
**Highscores:** Adding a highscore feature could add a competitive element to the game.
